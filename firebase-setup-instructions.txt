## Firebase Setup Instructions for PrepWise App

The application requires proper Firebase credentials to work correctly. There are two issues that need to be fixed:

1. **Firebase Service Account**: The FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL and FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID in your .env.local file are not valid.

2. **Authentication Flow**: The sign-in process isn't working properly.

### How to Fix:

1. **Generate a New Firebase Service Account Key**:
   - Go to the Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Select your project "ai-mock-interviews-ae40a"
   - Go to Project Settings > Service accounts
   - Click "Generate new private key"
   - This will download a JSON file with valid credentials

2. **Update Your Environment Variables**:
   - Open the downloaded JSON file
   - In your .env.local file, update the following variables:
     ```
     FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_from_json
     FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_client_email_from_json
     FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key_from_json"
     ```
   - Make sure to keep the quotes around the private key

3. **Try Logging In with Valid Credentials**:
   - If you haven't created a user yet, create one with the Sign Up form
   - Use a real email format and a password that's at least 3 characters

4. **If Still Having Issues**:
   - Check Firebase Authentication console to ensure users are being created
   - Verify that Firebase Firestore security rules allow read/write access

### Alternative Approach:

If you continue having issues, you could modify the application to bypass Firebase authentication by creating a development mode:

1. Edit auth.action.ts to create a mock user for development
2. Update isAuthenticated() to always return true
3. Create mock data for interviews in general.action.ts

This will let you explore the application without needing Firebase credentials.
